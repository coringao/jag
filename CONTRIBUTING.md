**How to contribute**
---------------------

I love contributions from everyone!

There are only a few guidelines that we encourage contributors to follow
so that we can accept and maintain third party changes.

Notice that JAG is licensed under the terms of the GPL v3 license,
so by submitting content to the JAG repository, you release your work
to the public domain.

**Getting Started**
-------------------

1. Make sure you have a [GitLab Account](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in).
2. Submit your issue (ensure the same issue does not already exists).
3. Try to clearly describe the issue, and include steps to reproduce
when it is a bug.

**Creating the fork in GitLab**
-------------------------------

Talk to us! E.G. create an issue about your idea or problem.

Fork the repository and work in a meaningful named branch that is
based off of our **master**.

    $ git clone https://gitlab.com/coringao/jag.git

Commit in rather small chunks but don't split depending code across commits.
Please write sensible commit messages.

Fix typos, comments or clarify language to improve the quality of the game.

You can contribute by translating the game into your (or other) language.

Propose an icon, a better drawable for an specific action, or even
a new material logo.

Please add tests for your feature or bugfix.

If in doubt request feedback from us!

When finished create a merge request.

Thank you for your interest!
